# ScrapeFandom
Fandom.com provides Wiki dumps at https://*.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Statistics, but most of the dumps are outdated, and require contacting an admin to produce a new dump.

This script scrapes Fandom.com for an updated Wiki dump. It scrapes the Special:AllPages to get a list of article names and requests a wiki dump from Special:Export.

Works only for English fandom sites. Some slight modifications are needed for other languages.
